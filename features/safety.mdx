Anchor AI provides comprehensive safety checks for tokens, ensuring that users can trade and interact with confidence. The safety check includes:

Using the Safety Check feature, you can:
1. **Token Safety**: Analyze the token's contract for potential vulnerabilities and risks.
2. **DApp Security**: Evaluate the security measures in place for decentralized applications (DApps) interacting with the token.
3. **User Protection**: Assess the protections available for users, including safeguards against scams and fraud.

### ðŸš€ How It Works
#### 1. **Token Safety Analysis**
- Anchor AI will analyze the token's contract for common vulnerabilities, such as reentrancy attacks, overflow/underflow issues, and other security risks.
- It will provide a safety score based on the analysis, indicating the level of risk associated with the token.
#### 2. **DApp Security Evaluation**
- Anchor AI will assess the security measures implemented in the DApp, including code audits, bug bounties, and security best practices.
- It will provide insights into the DApp's security posture and any potential vulnerabilities.
#### 3. **User Protection Assessment**
- Anchor AI will evaluate the protections available for users, such as anti-scam measures, user education, and community support.
- It will provide recommendations for users to enhance their safety while interacting with the token and DApp.
