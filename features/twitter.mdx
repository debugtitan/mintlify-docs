## 🧠 What It Does

The Twitter Agent specializes in:

- Monitoring behavior and activity of public Twitter
  accounts
- Tracking who follows which crypto/web3 projects
- Fetching global or regional Twitter trends
- Exploring Twitter communities (members, moderators,
  metadata)
- Searching for account info using a Twitter handle

This tool is especially useful for researchers, community
managers, traders, and growth teams wanting to stay ahead of
online sentiment and social signals.

## 🛡️ Input Rules

To ensure reliability and correctness:

- **Usernames**: Must be public accounts (e.g., `@elonmusk`
  → `elonmusk`)
- **Country**: Must be a valid name like `Japan`, `USA`, or
  `worldwide`
- **Community ID**: Must be a valid numerical identifier for
  a Twitter community

If any input is missing or invalid, the agent will ask
clarifying questions rather than guessing.

## ✨ Example Use Cases

You can interact with the Twitter Agent using natural
prompts like:

- **“Track if @elonmusk follows any new projects.”**  
  → Tracks new follows by Elon Musk

- **“What’s trending in Japan?”**  
  → Lists the top Twitter trends in Japan

- **“Search @jack on Twitter.”**  
  → Retrieves and summarizes public data about Jack's
  profile

- **“Who are the mods of community 123456?”**  
  → Shows the moderators of a given Twitter community

## ✅ Best Practices

- Use simple and direct language.
- Avoid abbreviations for countries or user handles.
- Let the agent guide you when inputs are unclear.
- Expect responses in clean, user-friendly summaries — no
  raw data dumps.
