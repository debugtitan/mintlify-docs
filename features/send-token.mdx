Anchor AI allows you to **automate secure token transfers**
from your wallets to any valid address, ENS domain, or
user-defined destination.

Whether you're sending funds to another wallet, a friend, or
a platform address, Anchor ensures the process is smooth,
accurate, and efficient.

### 🚀 How It Works

#### 1. **Wallet Detection**

Before initiating a token transfer, Anchor checks if you
have any wallets linked to your account.

- If one or more wallets exist, the agent will prompt you to
  **choose which wallet** to use for the transaction.
- If no wallets are found, you can ask the agent to **create
  a new wallet**, which will then be added to your available
  wallets.

This ensures that transfers are performed from a secure and
verified wallet under your control.

#### 2. **Wallet Funding**

Your selected wallet must contain the tokens you intend to
transfer, along with **a small amount of the native token**
(e.g., ETH, BNB, etc.) to cover gas fees.

- If the wallet doesn’t have enough balance, the agent will
  notify you and offer helpful suggestions such as:
  - Funding the wallet manually.
  - Swapping other tokens within the wallet to cover the
    required amount.
  - Bridging funds from another network if needed.

#### 3. **Token Resolution**

Anchor intelligently resolves token addresses. If the token
you specify exists in multiple versions (e.g., fake or
duplicate tokens), Anchor will:

- Match the symbol with the verified contract address.
- Ask for your confirmation if there are ambiguities.
- Ensure the correct token is being transferred.

### ✏️ Example Prompts

Here are some sample commands you can give to Anchor:

> “Send 0.5 ETH to vitalik.eth”  
> “Transfer 2000 ARAI to anchor.swap”  
> “Send 100 USDT to 0x3fa...b92”

Anchor will parse your intent, validate the destination,
check balances, and complete the transfer securely.
