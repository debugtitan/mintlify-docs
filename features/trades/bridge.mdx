  Automate cross-chain token bridging with Anchor AI.

Anchor AI enables you to bridge assets seamlessly across
different blockchains through a simple and intuitive
interface. It abstracts away the technical complexity and
provides a smooth user experience powered by intelligent
automation.

### 1. **Wallet Detection**

Before initiating a bridge transaction, Anchor checks if you
have any wallets linked to your account.

- If one or more wallets are found, the agent will prompt
  you to **select the preferred wallet** for the
  transaction.
- If no wallets are detected, you can **ask the agent to
  create a new wallet** for you. The new wallet will be
  generated and added to your list of available wallets.

This ensures all bridging transactions are performed from a
verified and secure wallet that belongs to you.

### 2. **Wallet Funding**

Once a wallet is selected, Anchor verifies that it has
sufficient funds to perform the bridge, including:

- The **amount of the token** you want to bridge.
- The **required gas fees** on the source chain.

If the wallet lacks sufficient balance, the agent will
notify you and provide options such as:

- Adding funds manually.
- Swapping from another token you already hold.
- Transferring from another wallet.

💡 **Tip**: Ensure your wallet holds a small amount of the
native token (e.g., ETH or BNB) to cover transaction and
bridging fees.

### 3. **Bridge Execution**

Once everything is in place, you can initiate a bridge by
messaging the agent directly. Anchor handles all the backend
steps like:

- Selecting the appropriate bridge protocol.
- Verifying token contracts.
- Confirming cross-chain routes and fees.

If any critical data is missing, the agent will ask you to
confirm or fill in the blanks.

Anchor also resolves naming conflicts by confirming token
addresses with you if multiple tokens share the same symbol
or name.
