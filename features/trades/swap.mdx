Anchor AI supports automated token buying and selling on
decentralized exchanges (DEXs).

### How It Works

1. **Wallet Detection**  
   Anchor first checks if you've generated any wallets.

   - If wallets exist, you'll be prompted to select which
     one to use for the transaction.
   - If no wallets are found, you can prompt the agent to
     create a new one for you.

2. **Wallet Funding**  
   Your selected wallet must be funded before the agent can
   process any transactions.

3. **Token Resolution**  
   If multiple tokens share the same name, the agent will
   resolve potential conflicts and prompt you to select the
   correct token before proceeding.

### Example Prompts

- “Swap 0.5 ETH to ARB”
- “I want to swap 3 ETH to USDC”
- “Can you swap 0.5 ETH to ANCHOR?”

If any required information is missing, Anchor will always
prompt you to provide it.
