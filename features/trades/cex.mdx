Anchor AI supports scheduling automated trades on
centralized exchanges (CEX) using **candle-based
triggering**.  
Trades are triggered **only when a specific candle interval
closes above or below a defined price target**.

### Getting Started

1. **Connect your CEX account** using your API key and
   secret key.
2. **Use the chat interface** to prompt the agent with
   natural commands. For example:

   - “Sell `$150` of ETH if the `1-hour` candle closes below
     `$2540`.”
   - “Buy `BTCUSDT` above `$70,000`  on a `15-minute` candle using
     `$500`.”

Once set, your trade will be scheduled and automatically
executed when the condition is met.
