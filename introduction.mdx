Anchor AI is an intelligent agent that empowers users to
schedule trades on centralized (CEX) and decentralized
exchanges (DEX), bridge their assets across chains, create
wallets, and assist with various blockchain-related tasks.

It achieves these goals by chaining calls to large language
models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Anchor AI is designed to
understand user objectives, implement strategies, and
deliver results autonomously—without requiring human
intervention. By leveraging LLMs, it can parse, understand,
and interact with complex systems and data in real time.
